# Coursera Video Downloader

This project uses Selenium (framework for automated browser testing) to replay actions needed to download videos from Coursera. Downloading videos from Coursera is an action allowed normally through the UI, so this is just a wrapper to avoid too many clicking.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository into your machine with Python 3 installed
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Update the variable `course_url` on the main.py file to point to the URL of the course


## To-do

Migrate the `course_url` variable to a parameter passed on the script call
